    <p>Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in web development. The front end is what users see and interact with and the backend is how everything works. Each side needs to communicate and operate effectively with the other as a single unit to improve the websiteâ€™s functionality. 

The front end is the part of the website users can see and interact with such as the graphical user interface (GUI) and the command line including the design, navigating menus, texts, images, videos, etc. The backend, on the contrary, is part of the website users cannot see and interact with.
The visual aspects of the website that can be seen and experienced by users are frontend. On the other hand, everything that happens in the background can be attributed to the backend.
Languages used for the front end are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while those used for the back end include Java, Ruby, Python, and .Net.</p>
