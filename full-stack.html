        <p>Full stack development provides a faster and more efficient development experience to build web applications, as team members are equipped with the knowledge of various technologies and tools and can use their diverse knowledge for development as well as future research. The two most popular technology stacks—i.e., MEAN stack and MERN stack—use MongoDB as their core database, which has a flexible schema and provides scalability and high availability for any project size.</p>
